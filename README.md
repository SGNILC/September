This is the first project I created during my Sophomore year of high school.

It is a website that displays the sales information of the K-Pop girl group, Loona (이달의 소녀). It took about 3 weeks to develop and was built entirely on the AWS IDE (offered at the time). I designed the web-layout, wrote the code, got it reviewed by online communities, and shared it on Twitter. It pulled in over 200 reactions in likes and shares. Please see it here: https://sgnilc.github.io/September/index.html

If I were to change anything, I would automate my program scrape data from other web sources and thus becoming moe dynamic. All current data was manually inserted, leading to time-consuming, repetitive work and 'old' data the month after its completion.

Nonetheless, I am very proud of the initiative and skill I developped by blending my passion of K-Pop listening and Technology.
