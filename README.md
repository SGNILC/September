My sophomore year of high school, I developed my first (independent) project. 'Loona's Statistics' was a website that showcased the sales information of the K-Pop girl group, Loona (이달의 소녀). It took about 3 weeks to develop and was entirely built on the AWS IDE (available at the time). I designed the website's layout, wrote the code, had it reviewed by online communities, and shared it on Twitter. It received over 200 likes and shares. You can see it here: https://sgnilc.github.io/September/index.html.

If I could change anything, I would automate my program to scrape data from other web sources, making it more dynamic. All data used was manually inserted, which led to time-consuming and repetitive work, resulting in 'old' data just a month after its completion.

Nevertheless, I'm very proud of the initiative and skills I developed by blending my passion for K-Pop listening and technology.
